### Description

Managing the digital assets - most notably code and data - created in your
research process are valuable outputs in their own right. Sharing these assets
is a corner stone of good research practice and thus increasingly supported by
universities and research groups as well as required by research funders. More
obviously, managing your digital research assets in a smart way makes your own
day-to-day life much easier! Unfortunately, data management, documenting your
code and deciding where to store all of it can take time and resource. Worse
still, there is usually more than one way of doing things and it far from
obvious which path you should take.

The purpose of this workshop is to share experiences in some of the core topics
of managing your digital research assets. Questions addressed include:

+ What is data management planning and why should I care?
+ How should I organize my code and data?
+ What should I consider when wrangling data to safeguard my own and my
colleagues' emotional well-being?
+ What are the basic principles of version control?

The workshop will present a highly opinionated view on various approaches,
services and tools. In other words, it will not be a comprehensive
presentation of all the alternatives available, but rather pragmatic and
battle-hardened experiences. Discussion, questions, objections and sharing
your own experiences is highly encouraged!

### Prerequisites

Bring your own laptop for note taking and for sharing your own examples.
